<!--Q-10. Why should background and color be used as separate properties? -->

<!-- Ans. There are two reasons behind this: 
    1)It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.

    2)Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.
