    <h1>What is the Ruleset?</h1>
    <p>The ruleset is used to identify that selectors can be attached with other selectors. It has two parts:<br>
        <b>Selector</b> - Selector indicates the HTML element you want to style.<br>
        <b>Declaration Block</b> - The declaration block can contain one or more declarations separated by a semicolon.
