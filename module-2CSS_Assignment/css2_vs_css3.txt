Q-3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?

The main difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is divided into different sections which are also known as modules. 
Unlike CSS2, CSS3 modules are supported by many browsers.

Apart from that, CSS3 contains new General Sibling Combinators 
which is responsible for matching the sibling elements with the given elements.
